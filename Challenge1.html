<h1>My Poem</h1>
<p>Charles Bukowski [1920-1994] was one of the most famous of the American poets of his time. He was first published in his 20s., but<br> gave up serious writing for the world of work and bars. He spent a lot of time roaming from job to job living in rooming houses from the East coast to the West coast before joining the United States Postal Service in Los Angeles.<br> His life at that time bordered on insanity and death, two prevalent themes in his writing.</p>
